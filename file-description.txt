Background of the project.....

This project consists in the following =>
    The first 2 contracts (One & Two) are contracts to mint NFTs, the contract number One will be the main contract to mint 10.000 NFTs and the Contract Two is to mint
    the second Generation of NFTs. The contract One has more functionalities than the Contract Two, =>
    this functionalities are the following:
        WhiteList Minting and also WhiteListe Tx and Wallet maximun mint permited. 
        Reveal function => Which allows to change the TokenURI to avoid trait snippig during the Mint Period.

    The third contract (Three) is a contract for a ERC20 Token, This contract will be in charge of creating a token for the economics of a Game. As you will notice,
    both Contracts One & Two have a "setLemonJuiceMachine()" function to connect to this contract throughout an Interface.
    There is an override in contracts One and Two (transferFrom & safeTransferFrom) to add the function from the contract Three UpdateReward. This function is commented for 
    this time because the contract Three is not finished.
